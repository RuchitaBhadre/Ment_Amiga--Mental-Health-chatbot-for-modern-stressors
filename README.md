# Abstract
Mental Health Chatbot to Address
the Psychological Impact of Modern Stressors


The escalating global concern surrounding mental health issues has been accentuated by a myriad of stressors originating from contemporary societal dynamics. These stressors range from the pervasive influence of social media intensifying feelings of inadequacy to academic pressures contributing to student stress, and broader challenges faced by immigrants adapting to foreign cultures. The result is a substantial population facing mental health concerns, hindered by barriers like the stigma associated with seeking help and limited accessibility to mental health services. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative solutionâ€”an AI-Powered Mental Health Chatbot.

Our approach encompasses addressing the stigma and barriers associated with traditional mental health care, acknowledging the reluctance of individuals to seek professional help due to fear of judgment or vulnerability. Additionally, we tackle the issue of limited accessibility to support by providing a 24/7 available chatbot that offers immediate assistance and resources. Embracing a holistic and preventive stance, our solution aims not only to alleviate existing mental health issues but also to cultivate resilience and coping skills proactively.

The final product is envisioned as an AI-powered Mental Health Chatbot that delivers accessible, anonymous, and stigma-free mental health support. This chatbot will employ AI-driven emotional support, offer guidance on self-help strategies, and, when necessary, facilitate connections to professional help. A key differentiator amongst our competitors is the facility to assess the user's distress level, provide tailored solutions, such as recommending remedies, connecting with helplines, and alerting loved ones. By developing a mental health solution, we take a holistic approach to mitigate the psychological toll of modern-day stressors and support mental well-being across diverse demographics.

The end product would be a mobile app with which the users will interact. This app will need permissions for other data sources through the mobile device for example smart watches, screen time etc.
